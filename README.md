#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.
-Soft engineering is the process of designing, testing and maintaining computer applications and programs. Some of its importance in the technology industry, include (but are not limited) to the following:
#1. It helps improve reliability in software programs
#2. It helps improve efficiency in software programs
#3. It helps in problem solving
#4. It helps reduce complexity of software projects
#5. It helps improve or enhance security
#6. It helps improve the flexibility and scalability of systems 

Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
#1. Mastering intelligence - In this stage, knowledge engineering had not yet appeared. The term Artificial Intelligence (AI) was coined, although some author ssuch as Alan Turing (from 1900 to 1956) had previously made proposals close to what would later be called AI.
#2. Mastering the Process - Due to the lack of clear methods, the transition of KBSs from research to commercial products was a failure in most cases. As no engineering method existed, the development process hadto face many problems. This occured between 1979-1989
#3. Mastering the complexity - Is an attempt to overcome the knowledge acquisition bottleneck, a new generation of methodologies in the earlynineties redefined KE from transfer/mining to a modelingperspective. This occured between 1990-2000.

List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
#1. Planning Phase- This phase involves dentifying the software requirement or purpose, scope and possible solutions
#2. Requirement analysis - This stage involves gathering all the specific details required for a new system as well as determining the first ideas for prototypes
#3. Design Phase - This stage is a necessary precursor to the main developer stage and where the developers will first outline the details for the overall application, alongside specific aspects, including the user interfaces, system interfaces, network and network requirements and databases
#4. Coding or Development Phase- Also know as the development stage, the coding stage is the part where developers actually write code and build the application according to the earlier design documents and outlined specifications
#5. Testing Phase - As the name suggests, during this phase the developers must examine the software for any bugs and glitches to ensure the end user experience will not negatively be affected at any point
#6. Implementation and Integration Phase - After testing, the overall design for the software will come together. Different modules or designs will be integrated into the primary source code through developer efforts, usually by leveraging training environments to detect further errors or defects
#7. Maintenance Stage - The SDLC doesn’t end when software reaches the market. Developers must now move into maintenance mode and begin practicing any activities required to handle issues reported by end-users

Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
Waterfall methodology is an approach to project management and software development that follows a linear sequence of events. In Waterfall, each phase of the project is gated. Teams cannot advance from one phase of the SDLC to the next until the current phase is complete. Each phase has clearly defined completion criteria. 

Criteria for the project are generated in the first stage of Waterfall (the requirements stage) and codified in documentation. The requirements set forth in the beginning ideally do not change during the course of a development project in this model. Waterfall suits projects that require a high volume of documentation and have repeatable, predictable processes. It is especially effective for projects with well-defined requirements and minimal expected changes, ensuring consistency and traceable control.

On the other hand, Agile is an approach to project management, specifically software development projects, that prioritizes collaboration, continuous delivery and customer feedback. Agile breaks work into iterative steps, which are smaller tasks that can be completed quickly. These iterations are done during sprints. Agile teams complete one sprint before moving onto the next one. Requirements can change at any time in the project based on changing business needs or customer feedback. Future sprints are based on the outcomes of previous sprints.

Since Agile limits the scope of work and focuses on adapting to changing circumstances, this methodology is ideal for complex projects in which unanticipated problems can arise and require development teams to pivot in response.

Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.
#1. A Software developer roles in a software engineering team include designing, coding, testing and debugging software applications
#2  A quality assurance engineer toles in a software engineering team include test planning and strategy, test Case design and dxecution, Automation, bug tracking and reporting, continuous intergration and continuous delively, performance and security testing
#3. Program manager roles in a software engineering team include planning, organizing, and overseeing the entire software development process, ensuring the project is completed on time, within the budget and according to the required specifications.

Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.
An integrated development environment (IDE) is a software application that helps programmers develop software code efficiently. It increases developer productivity by combining capabilities such as software editing, building, testing, and packaging in an easy-to-use application. Just as writers use text editors and accountants use spreadsheets, software developers use IDEs to make their job easier. Listed below are some of the reasons why developers use IDEs
#1. Code editing automation
#2. Syntax highlighting
#3. Intelligent code completion
#4. Refactoring support
#5. Local build automation
#6. Compilation
#7. Testing
#8. Debugging

Common types of IDE's you ought to know include the following:
#1. Local IDE's
#2. Cloud IDE's

What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.
#1. Rapid technological changes - One of the most significant challenges facing software engineers is the rapid pace of technological advancement. The rapid pace of technological advancement places considerable pressure on software engineers to stay current. The solution to this issue is constant updates, adopting a continous learning culture and using agile methodologies can help you stay keep your skills sharp in this every-evolving industry.
#2. Meeting tight deadlines - Another challenging element of being a software developer is the continuous cycle of tight deadlines. To avoid these issues a strategic focus on efficient time management within businesses is necessary to meet the challenge of tight time constraints. Well-planned deadlines can also give you and your teams ample time to inspect completed projects for mistakes.
#3. Debugging and trouble shooting issues - Developing software can be a challenging and error-prone process, and developers often need to spend a significant amount of time debugging and troubleshooting issues that arise. This can be frustrating and time-consuming, and can slow down the development process. However, by using Debugging and troubleshooting tools you can identify and resolve errors and other issues in your code. These tools and techniques are used to identify and resolve issues quickly and efficiently. These tools can help you quickly identify and fix errors, saving you time and reducing frustration. 
#4. Security vulnerabilities - As software developers create and maintain complex systems, it is inevitable that some vulnerabilities will be introduced. These vulnerabilities can be exploited by attackers to gain unauthorized access to sensitive data, disrupt services, or perform other malicious actions. To overcome these challenges, as a developer you should consider using a holistic approach to security. Below are a few tips that can help you overcome security issues on your software development project:
     a. Carry out all the necessary core operations to build a secure application
     b. When building your software, always use the latest version of the programming language.
     c. To enhance the protection of your software, look beyond technology.

Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.
-Testing levels, also known as levels of testing, refer to the different phases or stages of testing software during its development cycle. The main idea behind this concept is that each level of testing targets specific aspects of the software’s functionality, which allows for better quality assurance and fewer potential defects. Explained below are different types of testing:
#1. Unit Tests - Unit tests are very low level and close to the source of an application. They consist in testing individual methods and functions of the classes, components, or modules used by your software. Unit tests are generally quite cheap to automate and can run very quickly by a continuous integration server. They help ensure that each unit performs its intended function correctly, isolated from other components.
#2. Integration tests- These tests enables software testers to test group units integrated into a system or subsystems. They are vital because they help identify any bugs or issues arising from coding errors or integrations between modules. It is possible to automate integration testing.
#3. System testing - These tests are performed on an integrated environment comprising the whole application, where all components are assessed against specific business requirements. You can use automation tools for System Testing. They help verify that various user flows work as expected and can be as simple as loading a web page or logging in or much more complex scenarios verifying email notifications, online payments, etc.
#4. Acceptance tests - These are formal tests that verify if a system satisfies business requirements. They require the entire application to be running while testing and focus on replicating user behaviors. However, they can also go further and measure the performance of the system and reject changes if certain goals are not met.


#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.
-Prompt engineering is the process of giving instructions to a generative AI to produce requested results. From content generation to code generation, prompt engineering offers endless possibilities. Explore the latest innovations in prompt engineering and discover how it is shaping the future of AI. Explained below are some of its advantages or importance:
#1. Enhanced control
Prompt engineering fosters user control over AI more than ever by allowing users to control the AI models themselves with prompts. This, in turn, ensures that the most generated content closely matches the user’s needs and expectations. As stated earlier, the same mechanism could be employed with different writing services, including, but not limited to, content generation summarization and translation.

#2. Improved relevance
It ensures that churned-out outputs have context and are intended accordingly. This increases the level of practicality and excellence of implemented AI-based text products in different spheres.

#3. Increased efficiency
Effective prompts help develop an AI targeted in its approach to text generation through proper direction on specific tasks or topics. This automation is beneficial as it increases efficiency and reduces the need for manual involvement. Hence, time and resources are saved by optimizing the process downstream.

#4. Versatility
Prompt engineering approaches can be used across various text generation tasks and domains, making them essential for content generation, language translation, summary, and other broad range of applications.

#5. Customization
Prompt engineering is all about creating a suitable basis for the design of AI-driven products, taking into account a customer’s needs, tastes, and targeted group. That is the good side of flexibility, as it facilitates modifying content to fit the person’s particular goals and targets.

Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
Vague Prompt: "Write an essay about history."

Improved Prompt: "Write a 1000-word essay on the impact of the Industrial Revolution on the social and economic structures of 19th-century Europe."

*Explanation*
The improved prompt is more effective because it provides clear and specific guidelines for the essay. It specifies the word count, the topic (impact of the Industrial Revolution), and the context (19th-century Europe). This clarity helps the student understand the expectations and focus their research and writing efforts effectively. It also prevents ambiguity and ensures that the student's work aligns with the instructor's objectives.
